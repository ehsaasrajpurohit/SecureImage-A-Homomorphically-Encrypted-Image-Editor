This project focuses on securing media using homomorphic encryption implemented using the Paillier encryption technique. The primary aim is to devise an efficient method for selecting prime numbers used in Paillier encryption, utilizing the Rabin-Miller primality test. The main objective is to enable the editing of an encrypted image without accessing the actual image content. Subsequently, the edited image can be transmitted to authorized users who can decrypt and view it, thereby ensuring the confidentiality of the image.
